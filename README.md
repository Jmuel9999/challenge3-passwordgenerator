I am aware of the current bug that will not allow the assignment to work 100% properly, I will be fixing that. The program can only pump out one, two, three, or four characters for a password at a time. This is dependent on how many of the prompts the user says "okay" to. Any constructive feedback is always welcome and appreciated!
